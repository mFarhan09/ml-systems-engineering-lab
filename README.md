# ML Systems Engineering Lab

A daily practice repository for ML systems engineering problems — from configuration and data pipelines to ML algorithms and infrastructure.

## Purpose

This repository is intended to document and solve ML systems engineering problems on a daily basis. Each problem is organized into its own folder with:

- Problem description (`problem.md`)
- Solution code (`solution/`)
- Notes and key takeaways (`notes.md`)

## Structure

- `/problems` → Daily problem folders
- `/patterns` → Reusable components like logging and configuration modules
- `/notes` → Conceptual notes and learning summaries

## Example Workflow

1. Create a new folder for the day: `day_XXX_problem_name`
2. Write the problem description in `problem.md`
3. Implement the solution in `solution/`
4. Document learning points in `notes.md`
5. Commit daily with descriptive messages

## Requirements

Python 3.10+ recommended. See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
